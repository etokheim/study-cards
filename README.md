## 💻 Development environment

To get the app up and running for development environments you need to have `git`, `nodejs`, `yarn` and `npm` installed.

When you are ready, follow the instructions to start the app:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [url]
   ```
   - You can get the url from the top right corner (`Clone or download 🔽`)
2. Navigate into the cloned project:
   ```sh
   cd study-cards
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
   - This can take a minute or two depending on your network connection
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
   - This can also take a minute or two


## 🏅 Credits

Me, myself and I made this app with pure hard work and a couple sleepless nights – but it was all love ❤

The Expo splash-screen-starting-template also deserves some credits.
