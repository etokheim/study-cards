The app lets you make your own decks of quiz cards.

Press Correct or incorrect to continue.`

		question: 'How do I make a quiz?',
		answer: `First you have to create your deck. Say you have a science test at school, then you could call the deck 'Science'.

When you have your deck, you add quiz cards to that deck. Each card has a question and an answer.`

		question: 'How do you make quiz cards?',

Seems easy enough, right? ðŸ˜Ž`

2. Access your quiz everywhere â€“ on the bus, train or toilet, if you have 5 minutes you can study anywhere

3. Share your quizzes with your friends`

Just answer this question to finish the 'Getting started quiz', and go back to the deck page`
